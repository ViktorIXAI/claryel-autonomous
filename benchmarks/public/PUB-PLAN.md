# Public benchmark line (PUB) — plan and first rows

Started 2026-11-08 by owner decision: the hard-bank contour line is **frozen at the measured
stable stamp `0.0.2.56`** (hard-bank development stops at the measured numbers in
`../v6-results/VERSION-LADDER-PERCENT.md`), and the next workstream runs **public benchmarks**
with the same publication discipline: pinned task files, deterministic scorers, stored answer
bytes, one percent row per run.

## Rules of this line

1. A benchmark is one pinned task file: `benchmarks/public/<name>.tasks.jsonl` + `MANIFEST.json`
   (source URL + sha16). A re-fetch that changes bytes is a new version, never an in-place edit.
2. Scorers live in `scripts/pub_bench_score.py` and are deterministic (`number`, `letter`,
   `exact`). Execution checkers (`pytest` for HumanEval, `ifeval` rules) ship as separate
   contracts; until they exist, those tasks are counted as UNSCORED and excluded from the
   denominator — never scored by eyeball.
3. An arm is refused if >5% of answers are missing; partial arms publish nothing.
4. Cross-arm tables use one matched subset with the same task ids and the same call parameters
   (`temperature 0.7`, `max_tokens 1200`, one seed). Cloud arms are expensive, so the matched
   cross-arm set is 300 tasks; the local brain runs the full set. The matched set is the first 300
   ids of the pinned task file in file order, fixed before any arm ran — subsets are never chosen
   after seeing scores.
5. Contamination is stated per benchmark: the classic sets below are public and static, and are
   retired for frontier comparison in 2026 aggregators (last reported GSM8K 92.6%, ARC 95.3%,
   MMLU 90.1%). They are still the right first yardstick for a 24 GB quantized local brain, and
   every row says which model produced it.
6. Energy and wall time are recorded per arm like on the hard bank (GPU sampler for local legs;
   wall time only for cloud legs).

## Benchmark ladder, cheapest first

| # | benchmark | size | what it measures | local arm budget | cross-arm subset |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | GSM8K (test) | 1319 | grade-school arithmetic chains | ~55 min | 300 |
| 2 | ARC-Easy / ARC-Challenge | 2376 / 1172 | school science MCQ | ~40 min each | 300 |
| 3 | HumanEval | 164 | code synthesis, execution-verified | ~20 min (`pytest-v1` execution checker in force) | 164 (full) |
| 4 | IFEval | 541 | verifiable instruction/format compliance | ~25 min (needs `ifeval` checker) | 541 (full) |
| 5 | SimpleBench dev | 2500 → 500 | common-sense trap questions, **not saturated** (best public number 81.9%) | ~30 min on the subset | 500 |
| 6 | GPQA Diamond | 198 | expert science MCQ, noise ±3 pp | ~10 min | 198 (full) |
| 7 | MMLU-Pro | 12k → 500 | 10-option knowledge+reasoning | ~40 min on the subset | 500 |
| 8 | LiveCodeBench (post-cutoff window) | ~200 | contamination-aware code | ~40 min | full window |
| 9 | BFCL v3 | ~1000 | function/tool calling, AST match, multi-turn state | ~1-2 h | 300 |
| later | Terminal-Bench, SWE-bench Verified subset, GAIA-lite | — | agentic work in environments | hours each, only after 1-9 |

Item 4 (IFEval) and item 9 (BFCL) are where a harness can legitimately change the score, because
both score format and protocol compliance; the classic MCQ/math sets are scored on the final
answer, so there the measurement is the model, not the harness — that will be stated in the
result rows, not hidden.

### Source status (2026-11-08)

| set | tasks | tasks sha16 | source | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| gsm8k | 1319 | `7dd0080ff23b8bc3` | openai/grade-school-math test.jsonl | pinned, normalised |
| arc-easy | 2376 | `cac604a076e8b00a` | HF allenai/ai2_arc ARC-Easy test | pinned, normalised |
| arc-challenge | 1172 | `523af08216f14256` | HF allenai/ai2_arc ARC-Challenge test | pinned, normalised |
| gpqa-diamond | 198 | `af73cc064d4d8529` | HF fingertap/GPQA-Diamond (mirror of Idavidrein/gpqa) | pinned, normalised; mirror used because the upstream card is agreement-gated |
| humaneval | 164 | `971d976289cd9357` | openai/human-eval HumanEval.jsonl.gz | pinned; execution checker shipped as contract `pytest-v1` (`scripts/pub_bench_exec.py`, self-test: the reference solution passes and a wrong completion fails) |
| ifeval | 0 | — | HF google-deepmind/ifeval returns 401 (agreement-gated), the google-research raw path 404s | BLOCKED: try the `randxie-boson/ifeval-data` mirror, vendor the upstream `instructions.py` checker before running arms |

## Arms

* **brain-basalt** — our stable local stack: `qwen3.8-flash-next-iq3_s-basalt` on P2005 (24 GB
  class GPU, IQ3_S quant), no contour (contour gates are keyed to hard-bank task classes).
* **codex** — ChatGPT `gpt-6.1-sol`, xhigh reasoning, via the documented CLI transport.
* **grok** — `grok-4.7` via the documented CLI transport.
* **contour-0.0.2.56** — only on benchmarks whose scoring is format/protocol sensitive (4, 9), so
  a harness comparison stays honest.

## First measured row

| bench | model | tasks | tasks sha16 | call | strict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gsm8k | qwen3.8-flash-next-iq3_s-basalt | 25 (smoke) | `7dd0080ff23b8bc3` | temp 0.7 | **24/25 = 96.0 %** |

The smoke row is plumbing proof (3/3 spot-checked answers end with an explicit `ANSWER:` line and
match gold); the full 1319-task GSM8K arm is running as a systemd user unit and its row lands in
`PUB-DIGEST.md` when it completes.

## What "stop development" freezes

`0.0.2.56` is the last hard-bank contour stamp of this line: `harness/gate_versioning.py` keeps
the stamp, the adopted-line map, the pair verdict docs and the ladder stay published, and no new
contour feature is registered while the PUB line runs. Tooling fixes (scorers, runners, reports)
still ship, because measurement honesty is not model development.
